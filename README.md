The **Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms and offers detailed descriptions and precautions for each disease. It also allows users to fetch comprehensive information about a specific disease.

#### **Technologies Used**:
- **Python**: Backend logic and ML model implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes).
- **Tkinter**: GUI for user interaction.
- **CSV**: Dataset storage and retrieval.

#### **Key Functionalities**:
1. **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**:
   - Users input symptoms, and the system predicts the most likely disease.
   - Combines predictions from multiple ML models using ensemble learning.

2. **Disease Details Lookup**:
   - Retrieve detailed descriptions, related symptoms, and precautions for a specific disease.

3. **Interactive GUI**:
   - User-friendly interface for entering symptoms or diseases and viewing predictions and details.
